                <h2>Early Life:</h2>
                <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> was born on <time datetime="1985-02-05">February 5, 1985</time> in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, to a working-class family. He is the youngest of four children. His father, José Dinis Aveiro, worked as a kit man for a local football club, and his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, was a cook and cleaner. Ronaldo's early life was marked by humble beginnings, and his family struggled financially. Despite this, they were very supportive of his passion for football.</p>
                <p>From a young age, Ronaldo showed extraordinary talent for soccer. He started playing for a local amateur team, Andorinha, when he was just eight years old. His father’s involvement with the club helped him get his start. By the time he was 10, his skills had attracted attention from bigger clubs, and he joined Nacional, one of Madeira’s top teams.
    </p>
    <p>
                    At the age of 12, Ronaldo took a significant step in his career by moving to Lisbon to join Sporting CP’s youth academy. This was a big sacrifice for his family, as he had to live away from them. Life in Lisbon wasn’t easy for Ronaldo; he missed his home and struggled academically, but his football talent continued to grow.
                    
                    At 15, Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have ended his football career. However, after undergoing surgery, he made a full recovery and returned to the pitch with even greater determination.
                    
                    By the age of 16, Ronaldo was promoted to Sporting CP’s first team, and soon after, his talent caught the eye of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Alex Ferguson,</a> the legendary manager of Manchester United, which set him on the path to global stardom.</p>

            Many people look at me and think they know me but they don't at all. This is the real me. I am a humble person, a feeling person. A person who cares about others, who wants to help others.
